# Gooey

Gooey is a real-time chat application meant for less bloatedness and also meant to be fully open-sourced.

## Initialization

Due to the use of yarn, just run `yarn` to install all dependencies. You may also install each of them individually from this command here:

```
yarn add dotenv ejs ejs-lint express mongoose passport passport-google-ouath socket.io http
```

## Contribution

When contributing, ensure to follow this set of guidelines:

* Don't break anything
