# Gooey

Gooey is a real-time chat application meant for less bloatedness and also meant to be fully open-sourced (though that may change).\
Unfortunately, Gooey has to run on Electron.

## Initialization

Due to the use of yarn, just run `yarn` to install all dependencies. You may also install each of them individually from this list here:

```
dotenv ejs ejs-lint express mongoose passport passport-google-ouath
```
